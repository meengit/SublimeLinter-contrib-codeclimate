SublimeLinter-contrib-codeclimate
=================================

This SublimeLinter plugin provides an interface to the codeclimate CLI.

IMPORTANT!
----------

>>> This plugin may cause performance problems if many projects 
    and documents are open in SublimeText. <<<

I recommend deactivating the plugin globally by default and then activating 
it depending on your opened folders or as part of a SublimeText Project. 

To make this plugin work, please read the project's README.md carefully:
